/// The audit token property of an NSXPCConnection is private, for no good reason. Apple lets us "properly"
/// check the code signature of an `xpc_connection_t` using `xpc_connection_set_peer_code_signing_requirement`,
/// but gives us no such luxury for NSXPCConnections. The best we can do with public API is to check the pid of
/// the endpoint, but this also presents security challenges as pids are known to roll over and can thus be subject
/// to TOCTTOU attacks. This simple interface exposes the private property to us and lets us access it normally.
